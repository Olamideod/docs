## General

Learn about Protekt's core features, hosting, pricing, and supported frameworks.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What is Protekt?" icon="circle-question" defaultOpen>
Protekt is a lightweight permission management system you can integrate into your app to control user access to features and data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to host anything?" icon="server">
No. Protekt is fully managed — you only install the SDK and use the APIs. We handle infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a free plan?" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
Yes. We offer a generous free tier for testing and small apps. See our [pricing page](https://protekt.dev/pricing) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What frameworks does Protekt support?" icon="code">
Protekt works with any frontend (React, Vue, Next.js, Angular) and backend (Node.js, Python, Go, PHP) via API or SDK. See [all integrations](/integrations).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I install Protekt?" icon="download">
Follow the [Quickstart Guide](/getting-started/quickstart) for your preferred language or framework. Most integrations take less than 5 minutes.
</Accordion>

## Authentication and tokens

Understanding JWT tokens, expiration, refresh logic, and token management.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What kind of tokens does Protekt use?" icon="key">
Access tokens are JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), issued when your app authenticates via the SDK or API. Refresh tokens are also provided for long-lived sessions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long do tokens last?" icon="clock">
Access tokens expire after **2 hours** by default. Refresh tokens are valid for **30 days** and can be used to obtain new access tokens.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if the token expires?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
Your API request will fail with a `401 Unauthorized` error. Implement automatic token refresh logic or redirect the user to log in again. See [Token Refresh Guide](/guides/token-refresh).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize token expiration time?" icon="gear">
Yes. Token TTLs can be configured in your project settings in the dashboard under **Security → Token Settings**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I revoke a token?" icon="ban">
Yes. You can revoke user sessions via the dashboard or using the `/oauth/revoke` API endpoint to invalidate tokens immediately.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Permissions and roles

Questions about creating custom roles, assigning permissions, and checking user access.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I define custom roles?" icon="user-gear">
Yes. Use the dashboard or API to create custom roles with granular permissions. See [Custom Roles Guide](/guides/custom-roles).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How many roles can I assign to a user?" icon="users">
A user can have **one active role** at a time. You can switch roles dynamically if needed using the SDK or API.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I check if a user has permission?" icon="shield-check">
Use `hasPermission("permission.name")` from the SDK or the `/check` endpoint from the API:

```javascript
const canEdit = await protekt.hasPermission('posts.edit');
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I nest permissions or create hierarchies?" icon="sitemap">
Not yet, but you can simulate nested roles by creating grouped permissions (e.g., `admin.*`, `posts.*`). Full hierarchy support is on our roadmap.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

---

## Testing and debugging

Tips for testing roles locally, inspecting requests, and handling inconsistent results.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I test user roles locally?" icon="flask">
Use the dashboard to assign roles to your dev account or use mock roles via the SDK's test mode:

```javascript
const protekt = new Protekt({
  testMode: true,
  mockRole: 'admin'
});
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I inspect network requests?" icon="network-wired">
Use browser DevTools (Network tab) or Postman to confirm requests include:
- Valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Correct project ID in request
- Proper endpoint URL

See [Debugging Guide](/troubleshooting/debugging-guide) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I get inconsistent results with the same user?" icon="rotate">
Ensure you:
- Clear cached roles/permissions
- Remove stale tokens from storage
- Aren't running outdated code in multiple environments
- Check for race conditions in async code
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

Common errors like 403 Forbidden, 401 Unauthorized, CORS issues, and permission caching.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 403 Forbidden error?" icon="circle-xmark">
You're missing a required permission. Check:
1. User's assigned role in dashboard
2. Permission matrix for that role
3. Resource-specific permissions

See [403 Error Guide](/troubleshooting/403-errors).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My token is correct, but I still get a 401" icon="lock">
Verify that:
- Token hasn't expired (check `exp` claim)
- Token is sent in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Token belongs to the correct project (check `project_id` claim)
- API endpoint URL is correct

Use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to decode and inspect your token.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why does CORS block my request?" icon="browser">
Ensure your frontend's domain is listed under **Settings → Allowed Origins** in the dashboard. Add:
- `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- `https://yourapp.com` (production)

<Warning>
Never call Protekt API directly from browser in production. Use your backend as a proxy.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I changed roles, but permissions didn't update" icon="refresh">
Permissions are cached for performance. To see changes immediately:
1. Log out and back in
2. Clear browser/app cache
3. Call `protekt.refreshPermissions()` in SDK
4. Wait up to 5 minutes for cache to expire
</Accordion>

## SDK and API

Information about available SDKs, REST API usage, server-side integration, and mobile support.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Is there a JS/TypeScript SDK?" icon="js">
Yes. Install with `npm install @protekt/javascript`. Full documentation available in [JavaScript SDK Guide](/sdks/javascript).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Protekt with REST API only?" icon="code">
Absolutely. The REST API provides full access without using the SDK. See [API Reference](/api-reference) for all endpoints.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Protekt support server-side usage?" icon="server">
Yes. You can authorize requests server-side to protect APIs. We recommend server-side validation for production apps. See [Server-Side Guide](/guides/server-side).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Protekt in mobile apps?" icon="mobile">
Yes. Protekt works with React Native, Flutter, and native iOS/Android apps. See [Mobile Integration Guide](/guides/mobile).
</Accordion>

You can choose your region in project settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I audit user access?" icon="clipboard-list">
Yes. Use audit logs in the dashboard to track:
- All permission checks
- Role changes
- Token issuance/revocation
- API access patterns

Export logs via API or dashboard.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Teams and collaboration

Managing team members, project environments, and access control for collaborators.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I invite other teammates to my dashboard?" icon="user-plus">
Yes. Invite collaborators with three role levels:
- **Viewer**: Read-only access
- **Editor**: Manage roles and permissions
- **Admin**: Full project control

Go to **Settings → Team Members**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I manage separate projects for dev and prod?" icon="diagram-project">
Yes. Create multiple projects in your account (e.g., "My App - Dev", "My App - Prod") and manage environments independently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can teammates have different access levels?" icon="user-shield">
Yes. Assign dashboard roles to control access to settings, logs, and permission editing per team member.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Migration and versioning

Migrating from other RBAC providers and managing role/permission versions.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Can I migrate from another RBAC provider?" icon="right-left">
Yes. Import your roles and permissions using:
1. Our migration API (automated)
2. CSV/JSON import in dashboard
3. Manual setup with API

See [Migration Guide](/guides/migration) for provider-specific instructions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I version roles or permissions?" icon="code-branch">
Not yet, but versioning is on our roadmap. Current workaround: Use different projects for versioned schemas.
</Accordion>
