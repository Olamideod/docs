<Info>Use this glossary to get familiar with important terms used throughout Protekt's documentation.</Info>

## Authentication and authorization

### Access token
A JWT used to authorize API requests. Contains embedded user information and permissions. Expires after 15-60 minutes depending on configuration.

### Authorization
The process of verifying what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Happens after authentication.

### Authorization code
A single-use, short-lived code (60 seconds) returned after successful authentication. Exchanged for access tokens via your backend.

### Authentication
The process of verifying who a user is. Happens before authorization.

### Refresh token
A long-lived token (30 days) used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating the user. Can be revoked immediately.

---

## OAuth and flows

### OAuth 2.0
Industry-standard protocol for authorization. Protekt implements the Authorization Code flow for web apps and PKCE for mobile/SPA.

### Authorization code flow
OAuth flow for web applications with backend servers. User authenticates, receives authorization code, server exchanges code for tokens.

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
Security extension for OAuth used in mobile apps and SPAs. Eliminates need for client secrets by using dynamically generated one-time codes.

### Redirect URI
The URL where Protekt sends users after authentication. Also called callback URL. Must match exactly between code and dashboard configuration.

### Client ID
Public identifier for your application. Safe to expose in frontend code.

### Client secret
Private key for your application. Never expose in frontend code. Used to exchange authorization codes for tokens.

---

## Users and organizations

### User
An individual who authenticates with Protekt. Can belong to multiple organizations.

### Organization
A tenant in multi-tenant applications. Represents a company, team, or workspace. Also called workspace or team.

### Member
A user who belongs to an organization. Can have different roles in different organizations.

### Invitation
Email sent to add a user to an organization. Expires after 7 days. User must accept to join.

---

## Permissions and roles

### Permission
A named rule that defines what a user can do. Uses format `resource:action` (e.g., `users:delete`, `billing:write`).

### Role
A collection of permissions assigned to users. Examples: Admin, Manager, Member. Simplifies permission management.

### RBAC (Role-based access control)
Security model where permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users. Users get permissions through role assignment.

### Wildcard permission
Permission using `*` to represent "all." Examples: `users:*` (all user actions), `*:*` (super admin, all actions on all resources).

---

## Sessions and tokens

### Session
Server-side storage of user authentication state. Persists across requests using session ID cookie.

### Session ID
Unique identifier stored in a cookie. Used to look up session data on the server.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
Compact token format containing user information and cryptographic signature. Can be validated without database lookup.

### Token expiration
Time when a token becomes invalid. Access tokens expire quickly (15-60 minutes), refresh tokens last longer (30 days).

### Token refresh
Process of using a refresh token to get a new access token without re-authentication.

### Token revocation
Immediately invalidating a token before its expiration time. Works for refresh tokens and server-side sessions, not stateless JWTs.

---

## Security

### MFA (Multi-factor authentication)
Requiring two forms of verification to log in. Protekt supports TOTP (authenticator apps), SMS, and email codes.

### TOTP (Time-based one-time password)
Six-digit codes generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator. Changes every 30 seconds.

### SSO (Single sign-on)
Allowing users to authenticate using their company credentials. Examples: "Sign in with Google Workspace" or "Sign in with Okta."

### SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
Protocol enterprises use for SSO. Protekt handles SAML complexity so you just redirect users.



### OIDC (OpenID Connect)
Modern alternative to SAML for SSO. Built on OAuth 2.0. Used by Google, Microsoft, and other identity providers.

### Encryption at rest
Data encrypted when stored in databases. Protekt encrypts passwords (bcrypt), tokens (AES-256), and personal information.

### Encryption in transit
Data encrypted when transmitted between client and server. Protekt uses TLS 1.3 for all communication.

### CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)
Browser security mechanism. Protekt APIs require allowed origins to be configured in dashboard settings.

---

## Multi-tenancy

### Tenant
Another term for organization. Each tenant has isolated data and settings.

### Multi-tenancy
Architecture where multiple customers (organizations) share the same application instance while keeping data isolated.

### Organization ID
Unique identifier for an organization. Used to scope all data queries and ensure isolation between tenants.

### Organization settings
Configuration specific to an organization. Examples: MFA requirements, SSO configuration, allowed domains.

### Tenant isolation
Ensuring data from one organization never leaks to another. Critical security requirement for B2B applications.

---

## System components

### Protekt dashboard
Web UI at dashboard.protekt.com where you manage applications, configure settings, and monitor usage.

### Protekt API
REST API at api.protekt.com for programmatic access to authentication features.

### SDK (Software development kit)
Library you install in your application to interact with Protekt. Available for JavaScript, Python, Go, React Native, and Flutter.

### Callback URL
Same as redirect URI. Where Protekt sends users after authentication.

### Hosted login page
Protekt-managed authentication UI where users enter credentials. Keeps passwords off your servers.

---

## API concepts

### Endpoint
A specific URL path in the API that performs an action. Example: `POST /oauth/token` exchanges codes for tokens.

### Rate limit
Maximum number of requests allowed per time period. Protekt limits login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

### Webhook
HTTP callback triggered by specific events. Protekt can notify your application when users sign up, log in, or enable MFA.

### Pagination
Splitting large result sets into pages. API list endpoints return 50 items per page by default, max 100.

### Idempotency key
Unique identifier for API requests. Allows safe retries without duplicate operations. Valid for 24 hours.

---

## Compliance

### SOC 2 Type II
Security certification verifying Protekt's security controls through independent audit. Renewed annually.

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
EU privacy law. Protekt provides data export, deletion, and consent management APIs for compliance.

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
California privacy law. Similar requirements to GDPR. Protekt supports data access and deletion requests.

### Audit log
Record of all authentication events and permission changes. Required for compliance in many industries.

---

## Development

### Environment
Separate configuration for development, staging, and production. Use different client credentials for each.

### Local development
Running Protekt integration on your development machine. Use `http://localhost:3000` for redirect URIs.

### Production
Live environment accessed by real users. Use HTTPS for all redirect URIs and enable security features.

### Preview deployment
Temporary environment for testing changes before production. Generated automatically from pull requests.

---

## Error handling

### Error code
Machine-readable identifier for errors. Example: `invalid_grant`, `token_expired`. Used for programmatic error handling.

### 401 Unauthorized
HTTP status code meaning authentication failed or token expired. Typically requires user to log in again.

### 403 Forbidden
HTTP status code meaning authenticated but lacking required permissions. User needs different role or permissions.

### 429 Too Many Requests
HTTP status code meaning rate limit exceeded. Response includes `retry_after` indicating wait time in seconds.
