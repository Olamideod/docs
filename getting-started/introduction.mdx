# Welcome to protekt

Protekt is an authentication platform that gives you secure login, multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), and role-based access control (RBAC) as part of a single system. 
## Core features

1. User registration and login: Email/password, social, and passwordless authentication
2. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): SMS, authenticator apps, and biometric verification
3. Enterprise SSO: SAML and OIDC protocols for seamless integration
4. Session management: Secure token handling and automatic refresh
5. Organization and team management: Multi-tenant support with hierarchy
6. Role-based permissions: Fine-grained access control for your application


## How it works

Your application redirects users to Protekt's hosted pages, Protekt handles authentication, then returns secure tokens to your callback URL.

**Example Workflow:**

```javascript server.js
// 1. Redirect to Protekt
const loginUrl = protekt.getLoginUrl({
  redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/callback'
});

// 2. Handle callback
const { user, tokens } = await protekt.handleCallback(code);

// 3. Validate requests
app.use('/api', protekt.validateJWT);
```

This OAuth 2.0 flow ensures your application never handles sensitive credentials directly. Protekt manages password storage, MFA challenges, and session security while you focus on your product logic.
