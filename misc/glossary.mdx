# Glossary

Definitions of authentication and security terms used throughout the Protekt documentation.

## A

### Access Token
A credential used to access protected resources. In OAuth 2.0, access tokens are short-lived and contain user permissions (scopes).

### Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. Authentication answers the question "Who are you?"

### Authorization
The process of determining what resources a user can access and what actions they can perform. Authorization answers the question "What can you do?"

### Authorization Code
A temporary code returned by the authorization server after user consent. Used in the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow to exchange for access tokens.

## B

### Bearer Token
A type of access token that can be used by anyone who possesses it. Bearer tokens should be transmitted securely and have short lifespans.

### Biometric Authentication
Authentication using unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice patterns.

### Brute Force Attack
A security attack that attempts to gain access by systematically trying different passwords or keys.

## C

### Claims
Information about a user contained in a JWT or ID token. Common claims include user ID, email, name, and roles.

### Client
An application that requests access to protected resources on behalf of a user. In OAuth 2.0, clients are registered with the authorization server.

### Client ID
A unique identifier for an OAuth client application, used to identify the application to the authorization server.

### Client Secret
A confidential credential used by the client to authenticate with the authorization server. Should be kept secure and not exposed to users.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
A security feature that controls which web pages can make requests to a different domain than the one serving the web page.

## D

### Deep Link
A URL that links directly to a specific location within a mobile app, used for authentication callbacks in mobile applications.

### Domain
The unique identifier for your Protekt tenant, typically in the format `your-tenant.protekt.com`.

## E

### Encryption
The process of encoding information so that only authorized parties can access it. Protekt uses encryption to protect data in transit and at rest.

## F

### Federation
A system that allows users to authenticate with one service and access multiple related services without re-authenticating.

## H

### Hash
A one-way function that converts data into a fixed-size string. Used for password storage and data integrity verification.

### HTTPS
A secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data transmitted between the client and server.

## I

### ID Token
A JWT that contains information about the authenticated user, typically used in OpenID Connect flows.

### Identity Provider (IdP)
A service that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals (users, services, or systems).

### Implicit Flow
An OAuth 2.0 flow where the access token is returned directly to the client without an authorization code exchange.

## J

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are self-contained and can be verified without contacting the issuer.

## M

### Magic Link
A secure, time-limited URL sent to a user's email that allows them to authenticate without entering a password.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
A security method that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource.

### Multi-Tenant
An architecture where a single application serves multiple organizations (tenants) while keeping their data isolated.

## O

### OAuth 2.0
An authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access user resources without exposing credentials.

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)
An authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides identity verification and user information.

### Organization
A group of users within a multi-tenant application, typically representing a company or team.

## P

### Passwordless Authentication
Authentication methods that don't require traditional passwords, such as magic links, biometrics, or security keys.

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
An extension to OAuth 2.0 that adds security for public clients by using a code verifier and code challenge.

### Principal
The entity (user, service, or system) that is being authenticated and authorized.

## R

### Rate Limiting
A technique used to control the rate of requests a client can make to an API, preventing abuse and ensuring fair usage.

### Redirect URI
The URL where users are redirected after completing authentication, specified when registering an OAuth client.

### Refresh Token
A long-lived credential used to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
A method of restricting system access based on the roles of individual users within an organization.

## S

### SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, commonly used for enterprise SSO.

### Scope
A permission that defines what resources an access token can access. Scopes are requested during the OAuth flow.

### Security Key
A physical device used for authentication, typically supporting WebAuthn standards for passwordless authentication.

### Session
A period of interaction between a user and a system, typically maintained using session cookies or tokens.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
A session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications.

### Social Login
Authentication using existing accounts from social media platforms like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.

## T

### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
A temporary passcode generated by an algorithm that uses the current time as a source of uniqueness, commonly used in MFA.

### Token
A credential that represents the authorization to access a resource, typically an access token or ID token.

### Token Rotation
A security practice where tokens are regularly replaced with new ones, reducing the impact of token compromise.

## U

### User
An individual who interacts with your application and requires authentication and authorization.

### User Pool
A collection of users in a multi-tenant system, typically organized by organization or application.

## V

### Verification
The process of confirming the authenticity of a token, signature, or other credential.

## W

### WebAuthn
A web standard for passwordless authentication using public-key cryptography, supported by modern browsers and devices.

### Webhook
A mechanism for real-time communication between systems, used to notify applications of events like user creation or login.

## X

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
A security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

## Y

### YubiKey
A popular brand of security keys that support various authentication protocols including WebAuthn and TOTP.

## Z

### Zero Trust
A security model that requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.
