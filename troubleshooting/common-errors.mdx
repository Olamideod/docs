<Warning>Always test in a development environment before applying fixes to production.</Warning>

Protekt provides clear error messages to help you debug issues fast. This guide explains the most common integration errors and how to fix them.

##  Invalid or Missing API Key

This typically means your request didn't include a valid key.

<CodeGroup>
```ts API request without key
curl https://api.protekt.dev/secure-data
```
</CodeGroup>

###  Fix
Make sure your API key is included as a bearer token:

<CodeGroup>
```ts Correct Authorization Header
curl https://api.protekt.dev/secure-data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pk_live_abc123"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Store API keys in environment variables, never in frontend code.</Tip>

##  CORS Errors

If you're calling the Protekt API from a browser and get a CORS error:

<Warning>Browsers block requests to unknown origins for security.</Warning>

###  Fix
Use your backend to proxy the request or contact support to whitelist your domain.

##  Invalid Redirect URI

This happens during OAuth login when the callback URL doesn’t match any configured URI.

<CodeGroup>
```ts OAuth Error
Error: redirect_uri_mismatch
```
</CodeGroup>

###  Fix
Verify that your redirect URI in the Protekt dashboard matches exactly with the one sent in the login request.

## 
 Invalid Client ID or Secret

<CodeGroup>
```ts Token Exchange Error
Error: invalid_client
```
</CodeGroup>

###  Fix
Double-check your client credentials. You can reset them from the Protekt dashboard.

<Info>You can find your Client ID and Secret in the “Project Settings” tab of your dashboard.</Info>

##  Rate Limit Exceeded

<CodeGroup>
```ts 429 Too Many Requests
Error: Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60s.
```
</CodeGroup>

###  Fix
Implement exponential backoff and caching strategies to reduce unnecessary calls.

<details>
<summary>Show retry logic example (Node.js)</summary>

```js
async function fetchWithBackoff(url, retries = 3) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    if (res.status === 429 && retries > 0) {
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000));
      return fetchWithBackoff(url, retries - 1);
    }
    return res.json();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
```
</details>

##  JWT Expired or Invalid

If a protected route throws a 401 Unauthorized error:

<CodeGroup>
```ts 401 Error
Error: JWT expired or invalid
```
</CodeGroup>

###  Fix
Ensure you're storing and refreshing tokens properly. Use the refresh endpoint when access tokens expire.

<Tip>Tokens typically expire in 15–30 minutes for security. Always implement refresh flows.</Tip>
