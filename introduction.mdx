# Welcome to the Protekt Documentation!

This is the documentation for Protekt, an authentication SaaS platform that lets developers add secure login to any app in under 15 minutes. Install our SDKs, configure your auth flows, and ship features instead of debugging JWT libraries. It's that simple.

It covers everything from 5-minute quickstart to advanced enterprise features and API integrations. Here you can explore step-by-step guides and technical explanations for all authentication capabilities, plus discover optimization strategies to accelerate your development workflow. This also includes comprehensive API reference documentation covering how to build on top of Protekt through REST APIs, webhooks, and multi-language SDKs. These guides go deep on how to integrate and extend Protekt for your specific auth requirements.

## What is Protekt?

Protekt eliminates authentication complexity from your development workflow. Instead of spending weeks building password reset flows, session management, and GDPR compliance, you get production-ready auth infrastructure that scales from MVP to enterprise.

**Core capabilities:**
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS, WebAuthn)
- Enterprise SSO (SAML, OIDC) with zero configuration
- Role-based access control with organization management
- Real-time webhooks for user lifecycle events

## Who It's For

**Startup developers** building SaaS products who need auth fast without security compromises.

**Enterprise engineering teams** requiring SSO, compliance, and advanced security features.

**API-first companies** needing stateless authentication across microservices.

**Mobile app teams** wanting secure, offline-capable auth with biometric support.

## Why It Matters

Every 10-minute reduction in integration time cuts customer acquisition cost by $0.80. Protekt gets developers to their first successful login in under 15 minutes.

**Time saved:** 2-3 weeks per auth implementation
**Support reduction:** 40% fewer auth-related tickets
**Performance:** Sub-200ms token validation globally
**Security:** Zero-config protection against common auth vulnerabilities

## What You Can Build

**SaaS Applications**
Multi-tenant authentication with organization management, role-based permissions, and enterprise SSO integration.

**API Platforms**
Stateless JWT validation across microservices with automatic token refresh and fine-grained scope control.

**Mobile Applications**
Native iOS and Android SDKs with biometric authentication, secure token storage, and offline capability.

**B2B Products**
Enterprise-ready features like SAML SSO, audit logging, and compliance controls built-in from day one.

```jsx React SaaS App
import { useProtekt } from '@protekt/react';

function App() {
  const { user, login, logout, isLoading } = useProtekt();
  
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!user) return <button onClick={login}>Sign In</button>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}</h1>
      <p>Organization: {user.org.name}</p>
      <button onClick={logout}>Sign Out</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```javascript API Protection
import { Protekt } from '@protekt/node';

const protekt = new Protekt(process.env.PROTEKT_SECRET);

// Protect any endpoint
app.get('/api/profile', protekt.requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    user: req.user,
    permissions: req.user.permissions 
  });
});
```

```python Microservice Auth
from protekt import verify_token, require_permission

@app.route('/api/admin/users')
@require_permission('users:read')
def list_users():
    return {'users': get_organization_users()}
```
